What are my goals?

- I want to maintain a wine pipeline, so that I'm constantly
    paying for new wine but drinking properly aged wine. 
- I want to know what wine I own, and where I'm keeping it
- I want to drink exactly the right bottle of wine for this moment. 
- I want to see a map of wineries when I'm wine-touring. 

Where am I? 

- Winery/Liquor Store
    - I want my phone to guess which winery I'm in by my location. 
    - Or I could tell it. 
    - I want to know all of the wines offered by this winery. 
    - I don't have my laptop with me. I have a tablet or phone. 
    - I have wobbly internet access.  
    - I want to record my tasting notes on a glass I'm drinking
        - I probably won't have the bottle available to scan
    - I want to know a little about my stock
        - I want to know how many reds I have left.
        - I want to know how many whites I have left. 
        - I want to know how many dessert wines I have left.
        - I want to know how many cheap table wines I have left
    - I want to know how many reds and whites I have left. 
    - I just bought a bottle
    - I'm looking at a bottle, but I'm curious what the internet thinks about it
        - I don't have time for exhaustive research
        - I'm interested in what my friends thought about this wine
        - I want a simple "I'll probably like this/I'll probably hate this" decision.

- Kitchen
    - I don't have my laptop with me. I have a tablet or phone. 
    - I have internet access. 
    - I want to drink a cheap table wine with dinner. 
    - I want to drink a wine that pairs well with what I'm eating.
    - I want to drink a wine that's within its window of optimal drinkability. 
    - I want to know a little about my stock
        - I want to know how many reds I have left.
        - I want to know how many whites I have left. 
        - I want to know how many dessert wines I have left.
        - I want to know how many cheap table wines I have left
    - Once I've decided on a wine, I want to know where to find it in my cellar. 
        - I don't want to search through more than about one case to find it. 

- Cellar/Wine Cabinet/The Place Curtis Keeps His Wine
    - I have my laptop with me.
    - I have internet access. 
    - I have a whole cellar to organize.
        - The faster the better. 
        - I want to keep track of where I'm putting the wine, so I can find it later.
        - I organize my cellar by column/row
        - I organize my cellar by crate
        - My cellar is small enough that I don't bother to keep track of wine location
    - I have a crate of wine to add to my cellar. 
    - I want to see interesting reports about my wine
        - How many wines do I have by vintner? 
        - How many wines do I have by varietal? 
        - How much did I spend on my wine? 
        - How much is my wine worth now?
